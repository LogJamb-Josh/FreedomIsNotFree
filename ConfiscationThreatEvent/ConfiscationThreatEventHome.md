# May 2, 20205 Explosive Emotional Outburst at Odd Fellow-Rebekah Center

News reports indicate at 11:28 am on May 2, 2025, a SUV crashed into Odd Fellow-Rebekah center, less than 3 blocks from my house.

After a very late night, I was in bed when I was awoken by sirens down the street.  My memory is fuzzy, but I believe I looked out my bedroom window and saw where they were, put on the police scanner, heard it was a car accident, then fell back asleep.  I woke up several more times to more sirens and helicopters.

I eventually got out of bed and took a shower and drank some coffee.  Then I read about the accident online.  I didn't keep track of times at the time, but [WCIA](https://www.wcia.com/news/breaking-news/one-dead-after-car-hits-mattoon-nursing-home/) posted this article at 1:19 pm.

Some time after that, my old dog and I walked down that direction, the same walk I've done for years, about 3 hours after the event and over an hour after that news broadcast.  I met and talked with some neighbors who pointed me to another news article, and I even asked the local reporter about the event as he left.  I'm familiar with that building because my grandpa was there for a while.

I found myself alone on the corner of Wabash and N Logan.  I observed the taped off areas.  I knew the accident was far away (460 feet to the road, 600 feet to my location)  I walked toward the taped off area on Lafayette Ave and took two pictures.

This is when the police camera man popped out from behind a tree and became irate at the fact that I too was taking a picture.  He screamed he was going to comfiscate my camera and some other stuff I don't remember.  He caused such a scene that [this guy](Images/20250502_143315.jpg) came running over as evidenced in [this image](Images/20250502_143308.jpg).  Here is a [closer picture of him](Images/20250502_143352.jpg)

I prepared for him to confiscate my smartphone but he hid behind a police car and avoided eye contact.  He never talked to me again, as if the picture had now lost all importance.  I couldn't get his name.  I suspect the guy on the phone told him to deescalate.  It's already been on the news.

You can see in this [this video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mk8T5M9y48g5fxC2A) all of the people and reporters directly in the area of the crash.  I suspect this was some type of anti-phone training he received.  There is no other explanation for such an explosive reaction to my photo, while all of these other people are much closer with professional photographic equiptment.  His explosive reaction could have got me hurt.  It wasn't professional, and it violates the first amendment.
