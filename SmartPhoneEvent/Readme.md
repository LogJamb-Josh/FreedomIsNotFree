## Summary
I am a proud and responsible American citizen with a strong driving record. I have been recognized as an award-winning navigator in Competitive Mounted Orienteering competitions, demonstrating skill and precision across multiple vehicles including horses, dirt bikes, and ATVs. I earned a degree in Computer Science and developed the ION System for a debt collection law firm with a legal network spanning all 50 states. My work demanded strict compliance with information laws, and for seven years, my software facilitated tens of thousands of legal actions each month in multiple jurisdictions, including Coles County.
I hold deep respect for the Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees. Being stopped, identified, and ticketed for exercising a Constitutionally protected right is facially unconstitutional. Such actions are unlawful, unethical, and contrary to the principles that generations of Americans, including my grandparents who fought in World War II, sacrificed to defend. These practices erode public trust, undermine the rule of law, and harm innocent citizens. They create systemic problems that ripple far beyond a single traffic stop, threatening the very liberties that define our nation.
