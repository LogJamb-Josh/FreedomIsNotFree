# ACLU Rejection
## This is the rejection letter I got from the ACLU
January 21, 2025

Dear ­­­­Josh: 

Thank you for contacting the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. We have reviewed your situation carefully and we regret to inform you that we will not be able to accept your case.

The ACLU office is a legal center that involves itself with broad impact, constitutional litigation. These are issues where the government has abused constitutional rights.  Unfortunately, we regret that most cases of individual unfairness or injustice cannot be accepted. 

We receive more than 20,000 requests annually for legal assistance. Our resources are limited and we can only act upon a small percentage of the requests. The fact that we cannot help you, however, is not an evaluation about whether your case has merit. It may be that we are handling a similar case, that the case does not involve a novel issue pertaining to civil liberties, or that we do not have the resources to handle the case.

You should know that there is a limited time in which legal action may be pursued, sometimes referred to as a statute of limitations. You might be wise to ask an attorney for advice about preserving any rights you may have.

Please accept our regrets that we cannot help you with your situation.

Sincerely,

Intake Department
