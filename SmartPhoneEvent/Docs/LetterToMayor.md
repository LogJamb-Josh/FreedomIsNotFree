# Letter to Mayor
## Sent to hallr@mattoonillinois.org Oct 24, 2025 (Bounced back) Then hand delivered to Mattoon City Hall

Mayor Hall,

My name is Josh Overholt, and I live in Mattoon. In April 2024, I made a brief one-minute phone call to a business partner to ask if I could swing by, a gesture rooted in centuries of tradition across terrestrial, maritime, and aviation travel. That call resulted in a traffic stop by Officer Ronaldo Monte De Oca and a citation under 625 ILCS 5/12-610.2 for using an electronic communication device while driving. I contested the ticket in court before Judge Christopher Wetzel but ultimately lost. The ordeal cost me $164 in fines, $64 for a transcript from the wrong court date, and many trips to the courthouse. More concerning, though, is the lasting mark on my professional record, a consequence with serious implications in my field, where trust and compliance with legal standards are paramount.

I’m not a lawyer, but I understand how technology and communication intersect with local, state, federal, and international law. I believe I have a constitutional right to speak to anyone or anything I choose, a right protected by multiple layers of law. I also believe our elected officials at the highest level share this understanding, and I believe the American people stand firmly behind free speech. You see it everywhere: in slogans at Rural King, the open exchange of ideas online, the entrepreneurial spirit of Mattoon, flags at McDonald’s promoting delivery apps, signs at Walmart encouraging calls from your car, and the giant American flag flying on Independence Day. Even churches and late-night TV reflect our enduring freedom to speak.

These convictions are not just personal; they are echoed in our nation's highest courts. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that constitutional rights cannot be overridden by generalized appeals to public safety, especially when the activity in question has deep historical roots. In Bruen (2022), the Court rejected a “means-end” test that weighed government interests against individual rights. Instead, it held that any restriction on a constitutional right must be consistent with the nation’s historical tradition. Bruen reinforces a broader constitutional standard: rights are not contingent on discretionary enforcement or subjective interpretations of public safety.

I’ve been fighting this ticket for a year and a half. I’ve reached out for help from the ACLU, the original Chief Judge, the new Chief Judge, and the Illinois Attorney General, but I’ve made no progress. I tried to let it go, but my conscience wouldn’t allow it. I’ve taken a rational, honest, and straightforward approach, always in good faith, but it hasn’t gotten me anywhere. I’m committed to exhausting every state and local avenue I can think of before deciding my next move. That’s why I’m reaching out to you.

As both Mayor and Police Commissioner, you’re uniquely positioned to evaluate whether this citation reflects the values and priorities of our community. I’m asking you to take a closer look, not just at my case, but at how we interpret and enforce laws that intersect with modern communication. I believe this situation calls for thoughtful leadership and a willingness to question whether justice was truly served. If you’re willing to help me find a path forward, I’d welcome the opportunity to speak with you.

Respectfully,
Josh Overholt
