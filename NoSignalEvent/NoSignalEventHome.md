# No Signal Event Home

On this day, around 4am, I couldn't sleep and decided to look for the "outdoor exercise equiptment outside of the YMCA by the walking trail" as I was told be two separate people that week.  I knew generally where the YMCA was, but not specifically how to drive directly there.  It was 4am and practically alone in this town.  I found myself in a dark area and couldn't tell if this was a connecting road or a dead end.  I had slowed to a crawl partially pointed into the road to the right, trying to determine if I should turm here.  I decided not to.  I sat back straight up and checked my mirrors.  I observed a car appear behind me with bright lights traveling quiclky and accelerating.  I eaither had to accelerate quickly to get out of his way, or take this turn and slowly meander to this "outdoor equiptment" at my own pace.  I quickly chose to take the turn.  That's when this speeding car got direclty behind me, circled the building with me (if I remember right) then followed me to a well lit area and pulled me over.  He demanded an ID and said I didn't signal.  This was around 2 weeks after the ticket for talking.
