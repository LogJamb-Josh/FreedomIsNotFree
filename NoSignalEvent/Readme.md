On May 25, 2024, around 4 a.m., I couldn’t sleep and decided to look for the “outdoor exercise equipment outside of the YMCA by the walking trail,” as I had been told by two separate people that week. I knew generally where the YMCA was, but not exactly how to drive directly there. It was 4 a.m., and although I wasn’t the only one awake, it felt like I was alone in the town.

I found myself in a dark area and couldn’t tell if this was a connecting road or a dead end. I slowed to a crawl, partially pointed into the road to the right, trying to determine if I should turn there. I decided not to. I sat back straight and checked my mirrors. Suddenly, I observed a car appear behind me with bright lights, traveling quickly and accelerating. I either had to accelerate quickly to get out of its way or take this turn and slowly meander toward the “outdoor equipment” at my own pace. I quickly chose to take the turn.

That’s when the speeding car got directly behind me, followed me around the building, then followed me to a well-lit area and pulled me over. The officer demanded my ID and said I didn’t signal. I apparently failed to operate electronics to communicate with the people around me.
