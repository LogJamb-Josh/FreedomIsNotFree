# Freedom Isn't Free

This repository documents a series of personal encounters with law enforcement.

## Overview

There are three separate incidents of varying signifigance:

### 1. [Smartphone Ticket](SmartPhoneEvent/SmartphoneEventHome.md)
This is the most troubling event.

### 2. Warning for No Signal
This warning demonstrates using my hand to operate technology to communicate with others is required by law.

### 3. Confiscation Threat for Photograph
Another disturbing interaction with an irate law enforcement official.
